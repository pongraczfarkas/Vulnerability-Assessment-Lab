# Vulnerability Assessment Lab
## Description
This guide explains how I set up a Virtual Machine environment using VirtualBox with Windows 10. The purpose of this project was to gain experience with Nessus Essentials, learning how to scan for and remediate vulnerabilities. This project highlights two key steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle. Using Nessus Essentials, I will scan local VMs hosted on VirtualBox Workstation to conduct credentialed scans, identify vulnerabilities, remediate some of them, and then perform a rescan to verify the remediation.
## Utilities used

 - Nessus Essentials
 - CMD
 ## Environments used
 
 - Oracle VM VirtualBox
 - Windows 10 (22H2)

## Walkthrough
After installing my VM, where I will manage vulnerabilities, I need to configure the network adapter to be host-only so it can be on the same network as my host machine. This setup is necessary because Nessus needs to perform a Secure Server Login (SSL) into the Virtual Machine, and it's more straightforward if it's using my local network.\

I downloaded Nessus Essentials, my vulnerability management software. Since this download takes a considerable amount of time, I can multitask by also  configuring Windows 10 on the Virtual Machine, which is another lengthy process.\

I knew from previous experience that incoming ping will not work from another machine, so I turned off the Windows Defender Firewall.\

Then I gathered the IP address of the VM to figure out the IP address to use later with Nessus\

I attempt to ping the VM from my host computer to check if communication is possible. This step is crucial because if I can't ping the VM, Nessus won't be able to either, preventing it from running scans.\

After Nessus Essentials compiled I created a new Basic Network Scan.\

I gave a name to my new scan, supplied the VM's IP address to it and launched the scan.\

Let's examine the results! We have 31 findings: 29 informational, 1 low, and 1 medium. In a production environment, these would likely be left unaddressed. The informational results are probably due to some items lacking proper credentials and are not actual vulnerabilities.\

Examining one of the informational results, we see that the "Target Credential Status By Authentication Protocol" was triggered because no credentials were provided for this scan.\

Next, I configure the VM to accept authenticated scans and provide credentials to Nessus. Afterward, I will rescan the VM and compare the results. To start this process, I navigate to services.msc and enable Remote Registry. Enabling Remote Registry allows Nessus to connect to the VM's registry and conduct thorough scans for vulnerabilities such as insecure connections or deprecated cipher suites. I'm following these steps based on Nessus recommendations for conducting credentialed scans, though there might be alternative methods available.\

Then, I proceed to disable User Account Control (UAC). This step is necessary because the VM is not joined to a domain, requiring unconventional methods to ensure proper functionality. It's important to note that such actions are solely for experimental purposes and would not be employed in a professional or production environment.\

Next, I will access the registry and create a key intended to further disable User Account Control, enabling Nessus to establish connections as needed.\

With the registry settings adjusted I restarted the VM. Then I return to Nessus to configure the scan I set up earlier. I need to include the credentials—specifically, the username, password and domain of the VM—to ensure the scan operates correctly. These credentials enable Nessus to access necessary areas within the VM's registry. Then I performed a scan again.\

This new scan has identified significantly more vulnerabilities compared to the initial scan, thanks to its ability to conduct deeper scans within the VM with proper credentials.\

I'm curious to test the capabilities of this Nessus Scanner, so I'm going to download a very old version of some software, which likely has numerous vulnerabilities, to see if Nessus can detect them (I'm confident it will).
Links to the software I used:
 - Google Chrome: https://www.slimjet.com/chrome/download-chrome.php?file=win%2Fchrome32_68.0.3440.84.exe
 - Minecraft Server: https://mcversions.net/download/1.18.1
 - 7-Zip: https://7-zip.en.uptodown.com/windows/download/2157309
After I downloaded the softwares, installed Chrome, 7-Zip and unpacked the Minecraft Server. I purposely turned off Google Chrome Updates from the System Configuration so it doesn't update to the newest version and I can showcase the sweet alerts.\

Then I ran another scan.\

Looking at the vulnerabilities it can be seen, that we have for example Apache Log4J vulnerabilities from the Minecraft Server. It is amazing that Nessus can detect it from just the unpacked .jar file. \

For remediation, I turned the Google Chrome Updates back on and started looking for Windows Updates.\

I deleted the Minecraft Server files and uninstalled the 7-Zip.\

Now I made my final scan to see if I remediated the threats successfully.\

There are still some threats left but I will remediate these at some other time.
